# spicetifyconfig
Spicetify config/ setup that I've already tested and am currently using it, collected from Google and the Marketplace itself.

--- Snippets/CSS ---


/// Requires Spicetify Marketplace! ///

1. Declutch right sidebar: hide unnecessary stuff like merch, tours, etc, mine choosen to keep the author and credits only (@silver-wizard)
   
         .main-nowPlayingView-artistOnTour {
           display: none;
          }

         .main-nowPlayingView-merch {
           display: none;
          }

         .main-nowPlayingView-queue {
           display: none;
          }

        in case you wish to hide any part that you don't like, replace with these one
          main-nowPlayingView-nowPlayingWidget (cover art)
          main-trackInfo-overlay (title of track/ author + on the playback bar too)
          XxNYTMMTOE82fg4VfwMu (author info)
          main-nowPlayingView-credits (credits)
          main-nowPlayingView-queue (next in queue)
          main-nowPlayingView-artistOnTour (tickets & tour)
          main-nowPlayingView-merch (merch)
   

2. Rounded Images: add rounded corners to the cover art
   
3. Fix 'Episodes' icon: turn the episodes into monochrome icon
   
   Fix 'Liked' icon: turn liked songs into monochrome icon
   
4. Smooth Reveal Playlist Gradient: fade-in effect when reveals the playlist gradient header
   
5. Oneko: add a slepping cat (oneko) into the playback bar
    
6. Remove Popular sections from homepage: remove lots of clutter stuff like Popular radio/albums/new releases, etc
    
7. Smooth Progress/Volume Bar: enable the glide animation on playback/volume bar when changing
    
8. Hide Friend Activity Button: i don't have friend so i will hide it anyway which located on the top right corner
    
    Hide What's New Button: if you want to do the same with the bell icon aswell
    
9. Hide Mini Player Button: i don't find it useful so i hide it
    
10. Hide 'Scroll through previews': hide the previews icon of track
    

--- Themes ---

Personally, I love the default looks of Spotify so I'm not gonna change it.
But the default UI is missing rounded corners in the playing bar, i tried in snippets but it doesn't work for me.
So this is what I did...

Step 1:

<img width="697" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-10 at 15 34 36" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37755a59-613a-49ef-a42a-b8ccb9c1ba40" />

Step 2:
Install a theme called "Colorful" (@sanoojes)


  ** I installed it via Marketplace, but you can do it in CLI as well **

â†³ And there you have it. This will keep the original look (personal perference) and have a rounded corners at the playing bar as well.

<img width="1551" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-10 at 15 42 59" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/368462b9-d879-40ee-9afb-5a8c32548f03" />

Now enjoy the setup! ðŸŽŠ

# spicetifyconfig
This is my Spicetify config/setup that I've tested and I'm using now, based on lots of .js sources I found (included Marketplace for Snippets/CSS itself).
All the downloads will lead to the original author/link.

12. Hide 'Scroll through previews': hide the previews icon of track.

--- Themes ---

Personally, I love the default looks of Spotify so I'm not gonna change it.
But the default UI is missing rounded corners in the playing bar (Snippets doesn't work for me).
This is what I did...

Step 1:
<img width="697" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-10 at 15 34 36" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37755a59-613a-49ef-a42a-b8ccb9c1ba40" />

Step 2:
Install a theme called "Colorful" (@sanoojes)
  * I installed it via Marketplace, but you can you CLI as well *

And there you have it. This keeps the original look (personal taste) and have a rounded corners at the playing bar as well.
